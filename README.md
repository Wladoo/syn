# syn
> Generalized DNA for building real-time shared-state hApps on holochain

Syn: Etymology. From Ancient Greek œÉœÖŒº- (sum-), variant of œÉœÖŒΩ- (sun-), from œÉœçŒΩ (s√∫n, ‚Äúwith, in company with, together with‚Äù).

## Design

Read the [design documents here](DESIGN.md).

## Prerequisites

- Build the Holochain tools
  - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/holochain && cd ./holochain`
  - Ensure correct version of rust tool-chain via nix: `nix-shell`
  - Install conductor binary & dna-util binary:
``` bash
cargo install --path crates/holochain
cargo install --path crates/dna_util
```
  - Make sure the `path/to/holochain/.cargo/bin` is in your `PATH`

## Building the DNA

- Build the DNA (assumes you are still in the nix shell for correct rust/cargo versions from step above):
  - Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/syn && cd ./syn`
  - Assemble the DNA:

  ```bash
  make build
  ```

## UI

We have provided a test UI that implements a minimalist collaborative text editor.  To run this UI in test mode you can install [holochain-run-dna](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-run-dna) and spin up the conductor with:

``` bash
holochain-run-dna -p 8888 -i syn -u kitsune-proxy://CIW6PxKxsPPlcuvUCbMcKwUpaMSmB7kLD8xyyj4mqcw/kitsune-quic/h/proxy.holochain.org/p/5778/-- syn.dna.gz
```
Then you can run the UI with:

``` bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```
Now point your browser at `http://localhost:5000`

### Testing

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

#### Unit testing

  The `make test-unit` command runs all the unit tests for zomes in cargo.

  #### dna tryorama testing

  The `make test-dna` command packages/installs a fresh DNA and @holochain/tryorama tests it.

  ### Flushing üí©

  The `make clean` command gets rid of all compiled output.
