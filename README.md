> Generalized DNA for building collaborative hApps on holochain

Syn: Etymology. From Ancient Greek œÉœÖŒº- (sum-), variant of œÉœÖŒΩ- (sun-), from œÉœçŒΩ (s√∫n, ‚Äúwith, in company with, together with‚Äù).

## Prerequisites

- Build the Holochain tools
  - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/holochain && cd ./holochain`
  - Ensure correct version of rust tool-chain via nix: `nix-shell`
  - Install conductor binary & dna-util binary: `hc-install`

## Building

- Build the DNA (assumes you are still in the nix shell for correct rust/cargo versions from step above):
  - Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/sym && cd ./sym
  - Assemble the DNA: `make build`

  ### Testing

  ```bash
    cd ./tests
    npm install
    cd ..
    make test
  ```

  #### Unit testing

  The `make test-unit` command runs all the unit tests for zomes in cargo.

  #### dna tryorama testing

  The `make test-dna` command packages/installs a fresh DNA and @holochain/tryorama tests it.

  ### Flushing üí©

  The `make clean` command gets rid of all compiled output.
